### By coupling the system to an ancilla qubit, one can pump energy out of the system and store it in the ancilla qubit. By frequent resetting of ancial qubit, one would expect to reach the ground state energy of the system.
### The resetting is equivalent to applying a dispelling operator $\sigma^-$ on the ancilla qubit only. 

### $$H = H_{sys} + H_{ancila}$$
